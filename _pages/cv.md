### Identifying Heterogeneous Treatment Effect and Confounding Effect via Soft Decision Tree

- **Abstract:** In this paper, we develop a new method called $L_1$-Regularized Soft Decision Tree method to identify the heterogeneous treatment effect and confounding effect under a very flexible treatment effect framework. We first convert the main problem into a nonlinear variable selection task and prove that our new method can identify the relevant subset of the relevant factors consistently. We also discuss the asymptotic theory of the soft decision tree that can be a very effective method for resolving other nonlinear variable selection issues. In our empirical experiment, we find that $L_1$-Regularized Soft Decision Tree can identify the relatively meaningful factors, which is better than the results returned by other variable selection methods like Lasso.

### Unsupervised Feature Extraction Clustering for Crisis Prediction

- **Abstract:** This paper introduces unFEAR, an unsupervised feature extraction clustering method suitable for building crisis prediction models. Given a training sample of crisis and non-crisis observations and the corresponding attributes data, unFEAR groups the observations into time-homogeneous clusters by removing time trends and imputing missing data through the successive application auto-encoders. Each cluster can be associated with a different recurrent economic regime. On a first pass, crisis probabilities can be approximated by the crisis frequency in the cluster. Alternatively, once clusters are identified, supervised classifiers can be used to predict crisis events.

### Few-Shot Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Political Statement Analysis and Forecasting

[Github](https://github.com/rwang92/PoliStat2Vec-and-CNN)

- **Abstract:** In central bank monetary policy analysis, politicians' responds are often affect the robustness and effectiveness of policies for a country. Previously, we have witnessed a bunch of researches about forecasting the outcomes of monetary policy via content analysis on political statements of politicians. But there are two main limitations: first, researchers need to set many assumptions about the features in the statements, like the keywords. Second, there are few available labeled datasets for training learning algorithm. In this paper, we discuss a new way, few-shot learning, to solve the drawbacks above. We will show that few-shot learning CNN with domain adaptation is effective to extract relevant features when we have a few labeled target data and several large datasets with similar outputs but different domains.

### Nonlinear Slow Features Extraction via Auto Encoder in Time Series Analysis

- **Abstract:** Based on Slow Feature Analysis, we introduce a nonlinear slow feature extractor based on regularized deep autoencoder, which can not only automatically extract nonlinear slow features from the sequential data rather than manually design nonlinear transform in ordinary SFA but can construct more complex and abstract nonlinear slow features by stacking auto encoders layer by layer.
