### Few-Shot Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Political Statement Analysis and Forecasting

- **Abstract:** in central bank monetary policy analysis, politicians' responds are often affect the robustness and effectiveness of policies for a country. Previously, we have witnessed a bunch of researches about forecasting the outcomes of monetary policy via content analysis on political statements of politicians. But there are two main limitations: first, researchers need to set many assumptions about the features in the statements, like the keywords. Second, there are few available labeled datasets for training learning algorithm. In this paper, we discuss a new way, few-shot learning, to solve the drawbacks above. We will show that few-shot learning CNN with domain adaptation is effective to extract relevant features when we have a few labeled target data and several large datasets with similar outputs but different domains.

### Identify Unbiased Heterogeneous Treatment Effect via L1-regularized Soft Decision Tree

- **Abstract:** in causal inference, two main problems are widely discussed by researchers: identiﬁcation of heterogeneous treatment effect, and unbiased estimation of treatment effect, nuisance parameters or functions. Researchers have introduced machine learning method into causal inference for statistics and economics. Although researchers have solved two problems well enough, the combination of two problem still need to be. In this paper, we explore the identiﬁcation of heterogeneous treatment effect based on L1-regularized Soft-Decision Tree, which is a combination among soft decision tree, causal forest and double machine learning framework.

### Nonlinear Slow Features Extraction via Auto Encoder in Time Series Analysis

- **Abstract:** based on Slow Feature Analysis, we introduce a nonlinear slow feature extractor based on regularized deep autoencoder, which can not only automatically extract nonlinear slow features from the sequential data rather than manually design nonlinear transform in ordinary SFA but can construct more complex and abstract nonlinear slow features by stacking auto encoders layer by layer.
