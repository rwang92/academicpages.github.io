I am now a third year economic PhD student in Department of Economics, University of California, Riverside. My research field is mainly about machine learning in econometrics.

### Research Interests

**Machine Learning in Econometrics and Causal Inference:** unsupervised feature learning in high-dimensional economic data; estimation of treatment effect in Rubin causal framework via machine learning.

**Neural Language Modeling for Causal Inference and Forecasting:** political statement analysis via natural language processing and deep neural network; neural net-based content analysis and representation learning for causal inference
