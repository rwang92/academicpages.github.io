I am now a third year economic PhD student in Department of Economics, University of California, Riverside. My research field is mainly about machine learning in econometrics.

Research Interests
====

### Machine Learning in Econometrics and Causal Inference:

- Unsupervised feature learning in high-dimensional economic data

- Estimation of treatment effect in Rubin causal framework via machine learning

### Neural Language Modeling for Causal Inference and Forecasting: 

- Economic text data analysis via natural language processing and deep neural network

- Neural net-based content analysis and representation learning for causal inference
