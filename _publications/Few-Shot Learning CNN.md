**Abstract:** in central bank monetary policy analysis, politiciansâ€™ responds are often affect the robustness and effectiveness of policies for a country. Previously, we have witnessed a bunch of researches about forecasting the outcomes of monetary policy via content analysis on political statements of politicians. But there are two main limitations: first, researchers need to set many assumptions about the features in the statements, like the keywords. Second, there are few available labeled datasets for training learning algorithm. In this paper, we discuss a new way, few-shot learning, to solve the drawbacks above. We will show that few-shot learning CNN with domain adaptation is effective to extract relevant features when we have a few labeled target data and several large datasets with similar outputs but different domains.
