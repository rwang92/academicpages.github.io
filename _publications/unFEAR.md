**Abstract:** This paper introduces unFEAR, an unsupervised feature extraction clustering method suitable for building crisis prediction models. Given a training sample of crisis and non-crisis observations and the corresponding attributes data, unFEAR groups the observations into time-homogeneous clusters by removing time trends and imputing missing data through the successive application auto-encoders. Each cluster can be associated with a different recurrent economic regime. On a first pass, crisis probabilities can be approximated by the crisis frequency in the cluster. Alternatively, once clusters are identified, supervised classifiers can be used to predict crisis events.
