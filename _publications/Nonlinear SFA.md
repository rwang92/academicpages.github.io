**Abstract:** based on Slow Feature Analysis, we introduce a nonlinear slow feature extractor based on regularized deep autoencoder, which can not only automatically extract nonlinear slow features from the sequential data rather than manually design nonlinear transform in ordinary SFA but can construct more complex and abstract nonlinear slow features by stacking auto encoders layer by layer.
