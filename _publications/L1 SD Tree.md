**Abstract:** In this paper, we develop a new method called $L_1$-Regularized Soft Decision Tree method to identify the heterogeneous treatment effect and confounding effect under a very flexible treatment effect framework. We first convert the main problem into a nonlinear variable selection task and prove that our new method can identify the relevant subset of the relevant factors consistently. We also discuss the asymptotic theory of the soft decision tree that can be a very effective method for resolving other nonlinear variable selection issues. In our empirical experiment, we find that $L_1$-Regularized Soft Decision Tree can identify the relatively meaningful factors, which is better than the results returned by other variable selection methods like Lasso.
