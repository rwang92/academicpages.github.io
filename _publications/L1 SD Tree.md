**Abstract:** in causal inference, two main problems are widely discussed by researchers: identiﬁcation of heterogeneous treatment effect, and unbiased estimation of treatment effect, nuisance parameters or functions. Researchers have introduced machine learning method into causal inference for statistics and economics. Although researchers have solved two problems well enough, the combination of two problem still need to be. In this paper, we explore the identiﬁcation of heterogeneous treatment effect based on L1-regularized Soft-Decision Tree, which is a combination among soft decision tree, causal forest and double machine learning framework. Basically, It is straight forward to generalize the L1-regularized soft-decision tree into other differentiable methods. Thus, We also explore selecting variables nonlinearly via neural network with L1 regularization on the norm of first derivative.
